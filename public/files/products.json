    "description": "<p>Lenovo has done a good job in the main department &ndash; security. The ThinkBook 15 Gen 4 features a firmware TPM 2.0, as well as a privacy shutter, and a fingerprint reader. The Kensington Nano slot, on the other hand, will help you protect your device from theft. The build quality is also okay, but the base is a bit bendy. Probably because of the plastic body. Interestingly, the keyboard left us with mixed feelings. It has a backlight and it&rsquo;s spill-resistant. However, the key travel is super short. This is exactly the opposite of what we&rsquo;re used to seeing on ThinkPads, which is a huge argument against the ThinkBooks. At the end of the day, the ThinkPad E15 Gen 4 is a very similar product, that is better built, and in our opinion &ndash; is the better bang for the buck in the business world.</p>",
